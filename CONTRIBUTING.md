## Watch the videos

I've recorded several screencasts to demonstrate how to contribute.
Here's [a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV5CVI1eNcJi7lVVIuNyRhEuck1Z007BH) of them all. You'll find individual links by the respective sections. 

## Questions/Help

[Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXqFiSeBE-M&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJi7lVVIuNyRhEuck1Z007BH&index=2)

An example will get you help faster than anything else you do. Create a course by going to [Create Course](https://www.memcode.com/courses/new).

Join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/formly-js/angular-formly).

If you file an issue with a question, it will be closed. I'm not trying to be mean. I'm just trying to stay sane. :-)

## Pull Requests

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è  üëâ**Please follow our commit message conventions** even if you're making a small change! This repository follows the
[How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)
series on egghead.io (by yours truly). See
- [this lesson](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-write-a-javascript-library-writing-conventional-commits-with-commitizen?series=how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library) and

If you would like to add functionality, please submit [an issue](https://github.com/lakesare/issues)
first to make sure it's a direction we want to take.

Please do the following:
* Follow the existing styles ( _do we have an `.editorconfig` file?_ )
* Document your changes in the README
* Create an example for the website that demonstrates your changes so people can see how your changes work

### Development
_Ignore this section - refer to [README.md](README.md) on how to setup your dev environment_
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start` (if you're on a windows machine, see [this issue](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/305))
3. write tests & code in ES6 goodness :-)
4. run `git add src/`
5. run `npm run commit` and follow the prompt (this ensures that your commit message follows [our conventions](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)).
6. notice that there's a pre-commit hook that runs to ensure tests pass and coverage doesn't drop to prevent the build from breaking :-)
7. push your changes
8. create a PR with a link to the original issue
9. wait patiently :-)
